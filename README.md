# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using supervised machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer behavior and account information, the goal is to identify which customers are likely to stop using a service (churn), enabling businesses to take proactive measures.

## 📁 Dataset Source

The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle:  
🔗 [Telco Customer Churn Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

> 📝 **Credits**: The dataset was shared by IBM Sample Data and hosted on Kaggle by user [blastchar](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar). It is used here strictly for educational and non-commercial purposes.
